CIS267_Homework02_Brick Breaker Clone
This game is meant to be a clone of the classic game “Brick Breaker”

Problems:
•	I was unable to get the game over screen to work. I did try for quite a while to get it done, I just find it difficult and this is not something that we went over very much in class. 
•	Restarting breaks my score and life counting and I cannot figure out why.
